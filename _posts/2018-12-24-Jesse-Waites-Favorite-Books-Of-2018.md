This year I decided to make a list of my favorite books I read in 2018. While they did not necessary have to be published in 2018 to make this list, their inclusion here means that I finally got around to reading it this year. They are listed in no particular order.

<h2>Leviathan Wakes</h2>

<p>
I've spent more time with this book series and these characters this year than any other. Starting with Leviathan Wakes, the first book in The Expanse series, I've read all 8 of these books this year. The series covers the adventures of the crew of The Rocinante (A spaceship named after Don Quixote's horse in the novel 'Don Quixote' by Miguel de Cervantesas) as they engage in various missions throughout the solar system. The series is a big commitment but worth it if you're a science fiction fan. These books form the basis of the Amazon TV show "The Expanse", called by many critics the greatest science fiction TV show of all time.

<h2>The Punch Escrow</h2>

<p>
The Punch Escrow was a really fun book. The premise is that a man, on his way to begin a vacation with his wife, is involved in a teleportation accident. The book then splits into dual narrators, with each copy dictating the events he experiences after the accident. The protagonist(s) of this book are my favorite kind- The type that uses intelligence, quick thinking, and snark to outwit their opponents. I mean, yeah, I probably watched too much MacGuyver when I was a kid but whatever... To illustrate this, there is one scene in the book where the hero has to convince an artifical intelligence chatbot to 3D print a leaf of Atropa Belladonna, commonly known as Nightshade, to put himself into cardiac arrest, where he would be taken to a hospital and have the chance to escape his captors. Last I heard, the rights to the film version of this book have been sold and it may be made into a movie. I started following the author, Tal Klein, on Twitter and IG and he seems like a really cool dude, so it makes me doubly happy (Get it?) to be able to recommend his book.</p>

<h2>We Are Legion (We Are Bob)</h2>
<iframe style="max-width: 100%;float:left;padding-right: 20px" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=1680680587&amp;preview=inline&amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_sTzZwb050CJB9&amp;" width="336" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>
We Are Legion (We Are Bob) is the first book in the Bobiverse trilogy. I read all three of these in quick succession, and it was one of the most captivating series I've ever read. The general premise is that a software engineer wakes up after his death to discover that his consciousness has been placed inside of a computer. He has been assigned a job: His mind will be placed inside of a space probe, and he is to explore the universes. Bob is a smart guy, and begins making clones of himself in space, using 3D printing technology and elements found around the solar system, and holding meetings with his other cloned selves in a virtual reality meetup space known as The Bobnet. If I had to recommend a single book from this list to someone with an interest in engineering, it would be this one. This book series was so much fun.

<h2>Off To Be The Wizard</h2>
<iframe style="max-width: 100%;float:left;padding-right: 20px" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=1612184715&amp;preview=inline&amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_sTzZwb050CJB9&amp;" width="336" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>
"Off To Be The Wizard" is the story of a web developer that discovers a file online one day at work. His name happens to appear in the file, along with a bunch of fields and numbers. He adds 2 inches to the height field, only to discover that he instantly grew 2 inches. He creates a smartphone app to manipulate this file, and goes about manipulating reality, to comedic effect.</p>

I guess I should rename this post "My Favorite Science Fiction Books Of 2018", huh?
